# E-Learning
## Introduction
This cloud project focuses on hosting an E-learning website on the Azure cloud platform, leveraging Azure's robust services and infrastructure to ensure optimal performance, high availability, and disaster recovery capabilities. Three key Azure services are employed
1.Recovery vault
2.Load balancer
3.Traffic manager

### Topology
To provide a better understanding of the project's infrastructure, here's a simplified network topology for your E-learning website deployed on Azure with Azure Recovery Vault, Traffic Manager, and Load Balancer:

Here's a brief explanation of each component:

Azure Cloud: This represents the Azure cloud environment where your E-learning website is hosted.

Azure Recovery Vault: This service is responsible for data protection and disaster recovery. It ensures that your website's data and configurations are backed up and can be restored in case of data loss or a disaster.

Azure Traffic Manager: This service is used for global traffic management. It helps distribute user requests to the nearest and most responsive instance of your website, ensuring low latency and high availability.

Azure Load Balancer: The Azure Load Balancer evenly distributes incoming traffic across multiple virtual machines, which serves to balance the workload and improve the website's reliability and performance.

Virtual Machines (Web Servers): These are the virtual machines that host your E-learning website. These VMs are where your website's application code and data reside.

By combining these Azure services and virtual machines, you create a robust and scalable infrastructure for your E-learning website, offering redundancy, disaster recovery, and efficient traffic distribution to ensure a seamless online learning experience for your users.
